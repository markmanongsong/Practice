What are HTML and CSS for?
HTML is used to organise and create the core content of a webpage. You begin by writing words, and then you add tags or aspects to them. The web browser scans this and understands the page headline, any paragraphs, and where the page begins and ends, allowing you to fill your web page with content. The bones of the body are HTML, and the skin that covers them is CSS. Background color, styling, layout, borders, and shadowing are all examples of how it's used to make a webpage look slick and professional.
